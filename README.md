# Huffman_compression
Huffman compression and decompression project.

I did this project during my second year of prepa at EPITA. The data structures heap and bintree were made by my algorithmic teacher.

This program can compress and decompress string data using the huffman compression method.

To launch, you can call the functions compress() and decompress().
